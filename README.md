# SKIN CANCER DETECTION USING DERMOSCOPY IMAGES

> **Project Description:** The implementation of a deep learning-based diagnostic system aimed at analyzing dermoscopic images to provide accurate, automated detection of skin lesions and improve early-stage melanoma identification.

---

## About the Project
This project focuses on developing an automated system for skin cancer diagnosis through the analysis of dermoscopic images. By implementing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, the model classifies skin lesions into categories such as benign and malignant, aiming to provide a reliable tool for early melanoma detection.

### **Project Features:**

* **End-to-End Deep Learning:** The system identifies critical visual indicators like structural irregularities and color distribution directly from raw pixel data.
* **Image Refinement:** Advanced preprocessing techniques are used to remove artifacts such as hair and noise, ensuring the model focuses exclusively on the lesion characteristics.
* **Early Intervention Tool:** The application serves as a diagnostic aid to reduce the time required for manual screening and to decrease the subjectivity often found in visual examinations.
* **Optimized Performance:** Using frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, the model is trained on diverse datasets to ensure high sensitivity and specificity across various skin types.
